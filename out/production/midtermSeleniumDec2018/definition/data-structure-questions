Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A.
What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
insert, remove, search, peek
List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?

what is an Array?
static memory
what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Array's size is fixed, ArrayList can grow to accommodate
what is LinkedList?
Similar to ArrayList, but is composed of Nodes that have references to each other.
How is an Array different from Linked List?
Array's size is static, LinkedList can grow
what is queue?
FIFO structure
what is stack?
LIFO structure
what is FIFO and LIFO?
First in First Out, Last in First Out.
what is the order of complexity?
how much time and space a function needs
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
O(1)
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
O(N)
what is tree in data structure?
non linear structure
what is graph in data structure?
non linear structure
what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
HashMap uses map class that maps key value pairs
What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
How HashMap works in java?
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
Array index that does not exist gets accessed
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Looping through it, using class functions
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
array is static size, linked list grows to fit the data
What is DFS and BFS?
depth first search on trees uses a queue structure, breadth first search on trees
What is Recursion?
when a program calls itself
What are linear and non linear data Structures?
linear - array, linked list, nonlinear- tree, graph
What is Big-(O)-notation?
way to describe how much time and space something requires to complete
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
Mergesort, quicksort, and heapsort are O(n log n) and bubblesort, insertion sort and all the others are O(n^2)

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
